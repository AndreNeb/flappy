# Flappy Birds

This is a Java program for the Flappy Birds game. The program uses Java's Swing library to create a simple game panel where the player controls a bird to navigate through pipes.

## Code Overview

The code consists of a class named `GamePanel`, which extends `JPanel` and implements several interfaces for various functionalities.

### Fields

The class has several boolean and integer fields to manage the game state, timers, images, and sound. These fields are used to control the game flow, keep track of the score, and manage game elements.

### Initialization

The constructor of the `GamePanel` class sets up the game window, loads images, initializes game elements, and starts the game loop on a separate thread.

### Game Logic

The game logic includes methods for checking user input, updating game objects, and handling collisions. The `run()` method runs the game loop, which repeatedly computes delta time, updates game logic, and repaints the panel.

### Graphics

The `paintComponent(Graphics g)` method is responsible for rendering the game elements on the panel. It draws background images, sprites, and other visual elements.

## How to Play

- Use the mouse to control the bird's movement. Click to make the bird flap and avoid collisions with pipes.
- When the game starts, the bird will automatically move downwards. Click the mouse to make it fly up and pass through the gaps between pipes.
- Collect points by passing through the gaps between pipes. The score is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.
- The game ends if the bird collides with the ground or pipes. A game-over screen will be displayed, showing your final score and a medal based on your performance.

## Conclusion

This Java program demonstrates a simple implementation of the Flappy Birds game using Swing. The code can be customized and extended to add more features, levels, or animations to create a richer gaming experience.

To play the game, run the `main()` method of the `GamePanel` class. Enjoy the game and happy coding!
